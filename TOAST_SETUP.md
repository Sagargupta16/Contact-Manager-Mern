## Testing the Features

1. **Add Contact**: Try adding a new contact - you should see a success toast
2. **Edit Contact**: Edit an existing contact - you should see an update toast

4. **Error Handling**: Try actions when server is down to see error toasts

## Notes

- All toast notifications are non-blocking
- Error messages provide helpful feedback to users
- The delete confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous operations
